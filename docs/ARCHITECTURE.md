# Application Architecture

## Overview
This React application is built using modern web technologies and follows a component-based architecture. The application uses TypeScript for type safety and Vite as the build tool.

## Tech Stack
- React 18
- TypeScript
- Vite
- TailwindCSS
- Radix UI Components
- React Router DOM
- Framer Motion

## Directory Structure

```
src/
├── Components/       # Main UI components
├── SubComponents/   # Smaller, reusable component pieces
├── assets/         # Static assets (images, fonts, etc.)
├── data/          # Static data, constants, and mock data
├── lib/           # Utility functions, hooks, and helpers
├── pages/         # Page components and routing
├── utils/         # Utility functions and helpers
├── App.tsx        # Main application component
├── main.tsx       # Application entry point
├── config.ts      # Application configuration
└── globals.css    # Global styles
```

## Key Design Patterns

### Component Architecture
- Components are organized by feature and responsibility
- Shared components are placed in the Components directory
- Smaller, reusable pieces are in SubComponents
- Pages represent complete views/routes

### State Management
- React's built-in useState and useContext for local and global state
- Props drilling is minimized through context where appropriate
- Component state is kept as local as possible

### Routing
- React Router DOM for client-side routing
- Route-based code splitting for better performance
- Nested routes for complex page hierarchies

### Styling
- TailwindCSS for utility-first styling
- Class Variance Authority for component variants
- Global styles defined in globals.css
- Responsive design principles throughout

### Performance Optimizations
- Code splitting using React.lazy and Suspense
- Image optimization with lazy loading
- Memoization where appropriate
- Bundle size optimization

### Accessibility
- Semantic HTML structure
- ARIA attributes where necessary
- Keyboard navigation support
- Color contrast compliance

## Best Practices
1. Component file naming: PascalCase
2. Utility functions: camelCase
3. One component per file
4. Props interface definitions
5. Proper TypeScript typing
6. Error boundaries implementation
7. Loading states handling
8. Error states management

## Development Workflow
1. Component Development
   - Create component file
   - Define TypeScript interfaces
   - Implement component logic
   - Add styling
   - Test functionality

2. Feature Implementation
   - Plan component hierarchy
   - Implement routing if needed
   - Add state management
   - Implement business logic
   - Add error handling
   - Test feature

3. Testing Strategy
   - Component unit tests
   - Integration tests
   - End-to-end testing
   - Performance testing

## Build and Deployment
- Development: `npm run dev`
- Production build: `npm run build`
- Preview build: `npm run preview`
- Linting: `npm run lint`
